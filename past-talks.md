**Abstract**
An Introduction to using Vagrant to build configurable and portable development environments. Use easy to build and configureable development boxes to ease transitions between projects, test new libraries or patches, and make deployment to production easy, repeatable and boring (no more surprises or on-the-fly bug fixing). 

We'll be looking at Vagrant for local virtualization from a developer's POV discussing the reasons to use virtualization and comparing virtualization to containers. As developers, we can no longer expect Ops to take our application and make it work; we're responsible for knowing and understanding the integration points between our app and the underlying systems it runs upon. Having a defined environment that is consistent between development, staging and production is crucial to successful system deployment, and automating the configuration of that environment makes for simple & quick deployments to production (dare I say Continuous Integration?)

This Introduction to Vagrant will:

   * cover the concepts and nomenclature of Vagrant
   * demonstrate installation and management of Vagrant boxes
   * discuss the benefits of system configuration automation
   * compare / contrast containers to virtualization
   * demonstrate provisioning Vagrant with Chef
