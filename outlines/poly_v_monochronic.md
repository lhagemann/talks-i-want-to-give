# Polychronic vs Monochronic culture & DevOps

### Abstract
Time is relative. Or, Time is absolute. Both of these statements can be true depending on your personality, or the culture you were raised in. Working with people who do not see time in the same manner can be frustrating and lead to conflict. 

This talk will explain the polychronic and monochronic time systems, how different cultures relate to time, and finally how to take advantage of the strengths in each to build a better culture. 

Agile vs Waterfall. Scrum vs Kanban. In the end we are all trying to produce the best work in the most effective and efficient manner. So, I'll throw polychronic vs monochrnoic into the mix. Understanding time systems, and how they effect both inidividuals and teams can help technical leaders define the most effective approach for their company, while building a better collaborative culture. 


## Talking Points

* A monochronic time system means that things are done one at a time and time is segmented into precise, small units. Under this system, time is scheduled, arranged and managed.
* A polychronic time system is a system where several things can be done at once, and wider view of time is exhibited and time is perceived in large fluid sections.
* how to corodinate time sensitive personalities with those who see time as a little more fluid
* take advantage of the strengths in each to build a better culture and produce more work
* build polychronic approach into Agile planning
* for polychronics the 'how it fits into the bigger picture' is more important than 'how long it takes (will take)' to get done.
	* what's the value

	> "Polychronic businessmen cannot understand why tasks are isolated from the organisation as a whole and measured by output in time instead of part of the overall organisational goal. How can you separate work time and personal time? Why would you let something as silly as a schedule negatively impact on the quality of your relationships?"
